/*
Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1. int x = 5, y = 10; - Initialize two integer variables x and y with values 5 and 10, respectively.

2. if (x > 3 || y > 15) - Evaluate the expression inside the if statement.

Here's the order of operations:

a. x > 3 - Compare x (5) with 3. Since 5 is greater than 3, this condition is true.

b. y > 15 - Compare y (10) with 15. Since 10 is less than 15, this condition is false.

c. x > 3 || y > 15 - Since the first condition (x > 3) is true, the entire expression evaluates to true, regardless of the second condition (y > 15). This is because the logical OR operator (||) only requires one of the conditions to be true.

Since the if condition is true, the code inside the if block is executed.

1. printf("Both conditions are true.\n"); - Print the message.

Output:

Both conditions are true.
``
Note that the message is printed even though the second condition (`y > 15`) is false. This is because the first condition (`x > 3`) is true, which satisfies the logical OR operator.

If the first condition were false, the second condition would be evaluated, and the output would depend on its value. In this case, since the first condition is true, the second condition is not evaluated.

Here's the code with the output:
c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 10;
    if (x > 3 || y > 15) {
        printf("Both conditions are true.\n"); // Output: Both conditions are true.
    } else {
        printf("At least one condition is false.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
