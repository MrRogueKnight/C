#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 int x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;
 int result = x + y * z / (x + y);
 printf("Result: %d\n", result);
 return 0;
}

/*
Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1. int x = 5, y = 10, z = 15; - Initialize three integer variables x, y, and z with values 5, 10, and 15, respectively.

2. int result = x + y * z / (x + y); - Calculate the result using the given expression.

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. y * z - Multiply y (10) and z (15)
    - y * z = 150
2. x + y - Add x (5) and y (10)
    - x + y = 15
3. 150 / 15 - Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2
    - 150 / 15 = 10
4. x + 10 - Add x (5) and the result of step 3
    - x + 10 = 15

So, the final result is:

Result: 15

Here's the code with the output:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 10, z = 15;
    int result = x + y * z / (x + y);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result); // Output: Result: 15
    return 0;
}

This program calculates the result of a given expression and prints the output. The expression involves multiplication, division, and addition operations, which are evaluated in a specific order based on the rules of arithmetic.
