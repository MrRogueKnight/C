#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 int x = 5, y;
 y = x++ + x;
 printf("x: %d, y: %d\n", x, y);
 return 0;
}

/*
Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1. int x = 5, y; - Initialize an integer variable x with value 5 and declare another integer variable y.

2. y = x++ + x; - Assign the result of the expression x++ + x to y.

Here's the order of operations:

a. x++ - Increment x by 1 (post-increment), but return the original value of x (5) for the expression evaluation.
b. x - Use the current value of x (5) in the expression.
c. x++ + x - Add the results of steps a and b: 5 (original value of x) + 5 (current value of x) = 10
d. y - Assign the result (10) to y

However, there's a catch! The post-increment operation (x++) increments x by 1 after the expression evaluation. So, x becomes 6 after the assignment to y.

1. printf("x: %d, y: %d\n", x, y); - Print the values of x and y.

- x has been incremented to 6
- y holds the result (10)

Output:

x: 6, y: 10

Here's the code with the output:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 5, y;
    y = x++ + x;
    printf("x: %d, y: %d\n", x, y); // Output: x: 6, y: 10
    return 0;
}

This program demonstrates the use of post-increment operators and the order of operations in expressions.
