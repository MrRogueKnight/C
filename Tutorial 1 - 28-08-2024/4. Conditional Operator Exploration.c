Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1. int a = 10, b = 15; - Initialize two integer variables a and b with values 10 and 15, respectively.

2. int max = (a > b) ? a : b; - This line uses the ternary operator (also known as the conditional operator) to determine the maximum value between a and b.

Here's how it works:

- (a > b) - This is the condition being evaluated. It checks if a is greater than b.
- a > b evaluates to 0 (false) because 10 is not greater than 15.
- Since the condition is false, the expression evaluates to the second option after the colon (:), which is b.
- Therefore, max is assigned the value of b, which is 15.

1. printf("Maximum: %d\n", max); - Print the value of max to the console.

- %d is a placeholder for an integer value.
- max is the variable being printed, which has a value of 15.

1. return 0; - End the program and return 0 to indicate successful execution.

So, the output will be:

Maximum: 15

This program uses the ternary operator to concisely determine the maximum value between two variables and print the result.
