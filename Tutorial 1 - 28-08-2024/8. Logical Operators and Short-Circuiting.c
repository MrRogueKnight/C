#include <stdio.h>

Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1. int x = 5, y = 0; - Initialize two integer variables x and y with values 5 and 0, respectively.

2. if (x && y++) - Evaluate the expression inside the if statement.

Here's the order of operations:

a. x - Evaluate the value of x (5), which is a non-zero value, so it's considered true.

b. y++ - Evaluate the value of y (0), which is 0, but the increment operator (++) increments y by 1 after the evaluation. So, y becomes 1.

c. x && y++ - Since x is true (non-zero) and y++ is false (0), the logical AND (&&) operator short-circuits, and the expression evaluates to false.

Since the if condition is false, the code inside the if block is skipped.

1. printf("x: %d, y: %d\n", x, y); - Print the values of x and y.

- x is still 5
- y has been incremented to 1

Output:

x: 5, y: 1

Here's the code with the output:

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 0;
    if (x && y++) printf("Inside if\n");
    printf("x: %d, y: %d\n", x, y); // Output: x: 5, y: 1
    return 0;
}

This program demonstrates the use of logical operators, increment operators, and short-circuit evaluation in if statements.
